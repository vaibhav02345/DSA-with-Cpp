# 🔍 LeetCode DSA Tracker – Brute & Optimal (C++)

This repo is my personal space to learn, solve, and document key DSA problems using C++.

Each problem folder contains:
- ✅ Brute-force & optimal code (if applicable)
- 📘 Clean README with approach, topics, and learnings
- 🔗 Direct LeetCode link

Some problems may not have complete comments — I’ll improve code clarity as I go forward.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

📦 What's inside?

- 🔁 Arrays, Bit Manipulation, Hashing, Two Pointers & more
- 🔍 Each solution is hand-written — not copy-pasted
- 🚀 Built to be a long-term learning and revision archive
- 📚 Will keep adding more problems regularly

📚 Learning Resources

I've used:
- 🎥 [Apna College DSA Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe137I_EPQd34TsgV6IO55pt)
- 🌐 GeeksforGeeks
- 📄 LeetCode Discussions and Blogs  
...but I haven’t just watched and copied — I’ve enhanced my learning, written my own logic, and slowly built real problem-solving skills.

💡 Why this repo?

To move beyond just solving:
- 🧠 Strengthen logic with brute → optimal thinking
- ✍️ Learn how to explain my code clearly
- 🛠️ Build a habit of clean, real-world coding
