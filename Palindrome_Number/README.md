🔢 Palindrome Number

Link: [LeetCode 9](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)  
Tags: Math  
Level: Easy

✅ Approach

🔹 Reversing the Number

Check if the reverse of the number equals the original.  
Negative numbers are not palindromes by definition.

Time: O(log₁₀ n)  
Space: O(1)  

🧠 Concepts Used  

- Integer reversal  
- Modulo and division  
- Edge case handling (negatives, overflow)

📌 Notes  

- Simple math-based check — no string conversion used.  
- Watch out for overflow while reversing (handled by using long).  
- Common warm-up problem in coding rounds.
