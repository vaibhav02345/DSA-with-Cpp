Level: Medium

âœ… Approach

ðŸ”¹ Optimal (Two Pointer Technique)

Start from both ends and move the pointer pointing to the shorter line.  
At each step, calculate the area and track the maximum.

Time: O(n)  
Space: O(1)  

ðŸ§  Concepts Used  

- Two pointer technique 
- Area = width Ã— min(height)  
- Greedy reduction of search space

ðŸ“Œ Notes  

- Brute force would take O(nÂ²), but this pointer strategy brings it down to linear time.  
- A great mix of geometry, logic, and optimization.  
- Popular problem for testing pointer movement reasoning.
