ðŸ§© Product of Array Except Self

Link: [LeetCode 238](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)  
Tags: Array, Prefix Sum  
Level: Medium

âœ… Brute Force

ðŸ”¹ For each index, multiply all other elements except the current one.  
Time: O(nÂ²)  
Space: O(1)  

âš¡ Optimal Approach

ðŸ”¹ Use prefix and suffix product arrays to avoid division and reduce time complexity.  
ðŸ”¹ Final result is the product of prefix (left) and suffix (right) for each index.

Steps:
- Build prefix product array from left to right.  
- Build suffix product array from right to left.  
- Multiply them to get the result for each index.

Time: O(n)  
Space: O(n) â†’ can be optimized to O(1) (excluding output array)

ðŸ§  Concepts Used  

- Prefix product  
- Suffix product  
- Array traversal without division  
- Space-time optimization strategies

ðŸ“Œ Notes  

- Division is not allowed.  
- Final space can be reduced by using output array to store intermediate prefix results.  
- One of the most commonly asked array pattern problems.
